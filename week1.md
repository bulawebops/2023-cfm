# Learning is becoming more like God. 
Is sin a form of learning? No, but repentance is. Sin takes you away from God but repentance draws you closter to God to become more like Him. That's learning. Suppose you want to learn how to paint, you become like Him by enhancing your creative abilities. Perhaps you're an accountant or are really great with numbers, and if you are doing those things, building, making things have more order and clarity, that's becoming like God. So, take advantage of the gift of agency so you can choose to become like God.

An invitation to come unto Christ and become more like God in that process rather than just a checklist that I attend church, visit this family etc but to hopefully use our agency to discover who God is and have himâ€“invite him to become more a major part in my life. So as I embark in learning to become more like the Savior which is to be wise, not just knowledgeable. Put into practice to become more like God. 

Holy Ghost is the true teacher > receive message from the Lord >
Teachers     <=>     Learners relationship
won't share  <=>  this is boring

      Holy Ghost
teachers <=>  learners
D&C88:122 - edified together

how do we help learners comes prepared spiritually?
i am not a victim, i am an agent who can ACT, who can go to the Lord to answers and revelation.
in sacrament meeting or classes, someone is struggling to give a talk or teach in a class, we can pray for that individual. You can engage that speaker with your own eyes and with a smile and with encouragement.

how to empower more teachers? teachers role to serve learners. learning designer - design a learner experience. who the learner needs to become. who am I trying to serve? what do they need? what can i be doing to help more people? common thread > best teachers are made from the best students of the scriptures. Jesus Christ, there is nobody who learned better than Him. Nobody a better disciple. Best teacher and leader of all-time. So good to master learning.

### Rules for Learning
Run, jump, dig, pain, explore, examine, experiement, ponder etc. > pre-school.
### Rules for Parents
Watch and listen

#### Good coaching > model what you teach
Ask yourself, are you designing a learning experience for them to learn vs. watch and listen to you.
